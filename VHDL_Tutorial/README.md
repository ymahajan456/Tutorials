The codes can be skimmed through in the numeric order and they are well commented and the learning objectives for each clearly listed. A brief supporting presentation (in 2 parts) is available containing additional explanation.

[VHDL Overview](VHDL-overview.pdf) contains Prof. Dinesh Sharma's very detailed notes on VHDL 

## Software

To compile VHDL codes and view waveforms two softwares are required:

* GHDL: For compilation and simulation
	* Its documentation is available in the [GHDL](ghdl.pdf) PDF.
* gtkwave: For waveform viewing

In the folder named Installation all the necessary instructions for various common OSes are available. Refer to the PDF within the folder for more details.
